# landing-page
An entire webpage designed with HTML and CSS.

With this project I designed an entire homepage of a website
using HTML and CSS

Things that I learned:
- approaching a complex project by subdividing it into smaller pieces: the website
  can be subdvided in 5 horizontal parts (1 header, 3 sections, 1 footer).
  I approached this parts one at a time.
- First write down the HTML structure, then add the style with CSS.
